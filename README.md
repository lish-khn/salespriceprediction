# Sales Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting sales prices using Machine Learning, specifically Linear Regression. The dataset contains various features affecting sales prices, and the model is trained to understand these relationships to make accurate predictions. The project utilizes several data science libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn (`sklearn`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Pandas (`pandas`)
- Seaborn (`seaborn`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains multiple numerical and categorical features that influence sales prices. It undergoes preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature selection & scaling
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing data with Seaborn & Matplotlib
   - Checking correlations and distributions
3. **Model Training:**
   - Using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`
   - Splitting data into training and test sets
   - Evaluating the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score

## Results
The trained Linear Regression model provides sales price predictions based on input features. The model’s performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics.
